# Lab 13.0 - Worksheet

Name(s) and Login(s):



1. Examine the "search, find' section of the `main` function.  
   A key has been created that will match any team from California (CA).  
   Four searches are performed.

a) What is the result of the first search?


b) What is the result of the second?
  
  
c) What is the result of the third?


d) What is the result of the fourth (number 1B)?


e) Why did the same search produce different results for all 
   three searches even though we used the same key?


f) Observe that the fourth search (number 1B) was performed 
   under the same ordering as the first search, so why did 
   it produce a different result?
